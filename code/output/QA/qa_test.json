This allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary address and write (or overwrite) the memory residing at the specified address. Reviewing the TRAP_FRAME at the time of crash we can see IopCompleteRequest() copying data from InputBuffer into the OutputBuffer. InputBuffer is another parameter provided to the DeviceIoControlFile() function and is therefore controllable by the attacker. To do so, an attacker will need to allocate memory in userland that is populated with shellcode designed to find the Token for PID 4 (System) and then overwrite the token for its own process.

KoreLogic requests CVE number for the vulnerability, if there is one. KoreLogic also requests vendor's public identifier for the vulnerability along with the expected disclosure date. 2014.06.11 - Microsoft responds to KoreLogic that the vulnerability does not affect an \"up-platform\" product. Also requests that a CVE ID be issued to this vulnerability. 2014.07.02 - 45 business days have elapsed since Microsoft acknowledged receipt of the vulnerability report and 2014.07.18 - MITRE deems this vulnerability (KL-001-2014-003) to be identical to KL-001-2014-002 and issues CVE-2014-4971 for both vulnerabilities.

The following python script can be used to reproduce the vulnerabilities described below: from optparse import OptionParser  Parse the target options while len(data)<length:  Connect and send initialization packet   Choose one of the following and comment the others In the following subsections, we give the python code that can be added after the script above in order to reproduce all vulnerabilities. The vulnerability can be triggered when SAP Netweaver disp+work.exe module process a specially crafted network packet. Malicious packets are processed by the vulnerable function DiagTraceR3Info in the disp+work.exe module when the Developer Trace is configured at levels 2 or 3 for the \"Dialog processor\" component of the \"Dialog\" work process handling the packet [2]. This vulnerability could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the \"Dispatcher\" service. The following python code can be used to trigger the vulnerability: 8.2. The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted network packet to the vulnerable function DiagTraceHex in the disp+work.exe. This vulnerability could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to conduct a denial of service attack against the vulnerable systems. The following python code can be used to trigger the vulnerability: 8.3. The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted network packet to the vulnerable function DiagTraceAtoms. This vulnerability could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to conduct a denial of service attack. The following python code can be used to trigger the vulnerability: 8.4. The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted network packet to the vulnerable function DiagTraceStreamI and could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to conduct a denial of service attack. The vulnerability can be triggered by the vulnerable function Diaginput, allowing a denial of service attack against the vulnerable systems. The vulnerability can be triggered by the vulnerable function DiagiEventSource in the disp+work.exe module. : Core Security Technologies notifies the SAP team of the vulnerability, setting the estimated publication date of the advisory for February 21st, 2012. : The SAP team confirms the reception of the issue and asks to use the security ID 582820-2012 for further communication. In particular, Core does not guarantee that the publication of the advisory will be postponed until a fix or patch is made available by SAP. If information about this vulnerability is partially or completely leaked by a third party, the advisory would be released immediately as forced release. 2012-02-22: Core asks for the status of the fix and notifies that the release date was missed. 2012-04-16: Core asks if the patching process is still on track to release patches on May 8th and requests a status of the fix. : Core notifies that everything is ready for publication and requests the vendor to confirm the release date and the list of affected platforms (no reply received). -05-07: Core asks again for the status of the fix. : Core replies that the reporting of vulnerabilities is aimed at helping vulnerable users to understand and address the issues; the advisory will thus be released with the technical information.

The first class of issues can be exploited only when SNMP debugging is enabled, as they are related with the debugging code that displays the content of incoming SNMP packets. Attackers can leverage these issues to achieve RCE, but the actual impact is quite low, as SNMP debugging is usually disabled during normal operation. Differently than the previous ones, these issues can be exploited in the default device configuration. Additionally, it is worth considering that ACLs are ineffective at mitigating this threat, as SNMPv3 packets are processed by the device even if the sender's IP is not included in the ACL. Similarly, the vulnerabilities can be exploited even when no SNMPv3 users are configured. Our PoC simply crashes the device, but the payload can probably be also adapted to achieve RCE.
